<p>I realize this is the most obvious thing ever, but everywhere I have worked has had a huge knowledge base of tips, tricks, processes, etc and a meager wiki with sparse, outdated, or worse, useless information.</p> <p>I have always been a champion of the wiki, and while a wiki can easily grow out of sync with the business, if you find yourself answering the same questions week after week, you need to document that somewhere, and a text document checked into code control doesn&#039;t count! Why not? You can&#039;t easily search across hundreds of text documents to find something, and if you <i>are</i> that tedious, then you also have to remember to update it <i>before</i> you search, otherwise you get stale information. And if you have that kind of free time and spare memory, you and I need to have a talk.</p> <p>So, a wiki it is. It is always up to date, always on, accessable anywhere with internet. Brilliant. </p> <p>And, most importantly, when someone asks me a familiar question, I simply tell them to Put It In The Wiki, because next time the first thing out of my mouth is Did You Check the Wiki?<br /> </p>
