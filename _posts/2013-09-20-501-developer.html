  Can we agree for this post that money, energy, time, and effort are all forms
  of power? Like literally, if I wanted to build a building, I am
  going to need tools, skills, materials, labor. I can use the most
  liquid form of power I have (cash) to aquire all these things, or I
  can use a much less liquid form of power (my time) to harvest,
  extract, refine, learn, and build my building myself. Usually,
  economies of scale mean it is dramatically more efficient for me to
  specialize in one way of converting time into liquid power. Then,
  when I need something, I simply pass that power on to someone else
  who also specializes and therefore produces at a much more efficient
  rate whatever it is I need.

  Now you know why I don't quarry my own stone to build an amphitheater in
  my back yard.

  On to the point! I read a post today, about the 5:01 developer. It made me mad.

  Ideas like this are so protectionist, so subtle, that they just soak
  into your psyche. I don't think anyone would say under normal conditions,
  "I should really work for free today". But,
  effectively, that is what this whole phrase is about. The phrase
  lets some people who cram eight hours of work into ten or
  eleven hours to "get back" at those that get the same work done in
  six to eight. This phrase is not about "saving the company" or
  "giving back to society", those are unusual conditions. Some
  buddies from work and I donated some programming to a local charity
  a few months back, but it was my first time in six years.
  A "5:01 Developer" isn't meant to be a chastisement of developers who don't "give
  back to society". No, it is a chastisement of developers who don't
  "give back to the company". Sort of a tax, for the priviledge of
  getting paid to work there, you should, according to this ideal,
  just "give back" some of that power they gave you.

  In my experience, very few offices care enough about
  their developers to let them sharpen their saws at work, so, why
  would you waste your precious time there? Will they pay you
  more for it? Doubtful. Will they be less likely to fire you when the
  need arises? <i>Maybe</i>. Sounds to me like a lot of speculation.
