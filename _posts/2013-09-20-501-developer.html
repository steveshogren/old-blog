  Can we agree for this post that money, energy, time, and effort are all forms
  of power? Like literally, if I wanted to build a building, I am
  going to need tools, skills, materials, labor. I can use the most
  liquid form of power I have (cash) to aquire all these things, or I
  can use a much less liquid form of power (my time) to harvest,
  extract, refine, learn, and build my building myself. Usually,
  economies of scale mean it is dramatically more efficient for me to
  specialize in one way of converting time into liquid power. Then,
  when I need something, I simply pass that power on to someone else
  who also specializes and therefore produces at a much more efficient
  rate whatever it is I need.

  Now you know why I don't quarry my own stone to build an amphitheater in
  my back yard.

  When you work a job, you are converting one form of power you have:
  time (and usually skills), into another much more liquid form of
  power: money. One can extend the model to include the
  calories and shelter (the power to sleep safely) along with
  that time and skills. Great, this is just basic economics, right?
  You need power (money) to buy power (food and shelter) to buy power (time)
  to convert back into more power (money). Ideally, since you are
  "harvesting" something finite and therefore scarce to this whole system
  (time out of your short life), if you are disciplined, can
  consistently end up with a net positive.

  On to the point! I read a post today mentioning
  the <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DarkMatterDevelopersTheUnseen99.aspx">
  "5:01 developer"</a>. It made me mad.

  Ideas like this are so protectionist, so subtle, that they just seep
  into your psyche. I don't think anyone would say under normal conditions,
  "I should really work for free today". But,
  effectively, that is what this whole phrase is about. The phrase
  lets people who cram eight hours of work into ten hours
  "get back" at those that get the same work done in
  six to eight. This phrase is not about "saving the company" or
  "giving back to society", those are unusual conditions. Some
  buddies from work and I donated some programming to a local charity
  a few months back, but it was my first time in six years.
  A "5:01 Developer" isn't meant to be a chastisement of developers who don't "give
  back to society". No, it is a chastisement of developers who don't
  "give back to the company". Sort of a tax, for the priviledge of
  getting paid to work there, you should, according to this ideal,
  just "give back" some of that power they gave you. Thinking about
  this with the "power" model, you should accept money to work there
  in exchange for your time, but, when the time comes, you should give
  them extra, like a tip.

  In my experience, very few offices care enough about
  their developers to let them sharpen their saws at work, so, why
  would you waste your precious time there? Will they pay you
  more for it? Doubtful. Will they be less likely to fire you when the
  need arises? <i>Maybe</i>. Sounds to me like a lot of speculation.

  At a few points in my career, I worked longer hours. Once it was
  because I truely enjoyed the work and it was fun. Another time it
  was because I felt like the extra time was going to directly pay off
  as an investment (it didn't). A few times I have stuck around to "wrap this off"
  or "help out with something unusual" (and by that I mean, once every
  year or so unusual). I recently recommended to my
  little brother he work longer hours, as he was
  hired without many needed skills. He worked out a deal where he
  spent two extra hours a day for a couple months reading and practicing to
  get "caught up". His boss got to see his hustle when he was first
  one in and last one out every day; he got to study away from the
  distractions of life. In all circumstances, overtime is the exception, never the rule.

  One last point. I make it a daily habit these days to spend ~5-10
  hours a week outside work advancing my skills. I practice
  interactive rebases, work through some awesome books, do online
  courses, work on side projects, contribute to open source, learn new
  languages.
