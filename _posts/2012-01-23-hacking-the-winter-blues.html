I moved to the Philadelphia region from east Texas about two years ago, and last month I realized that I get some serious blues around winter time. Since I have no desire to be controlled anything I can prevent, I decided to take the offensive!

After reading several places (like <a href="http://paleohacks.com/questions/318/how-can-i-hack-my-sleep/334#334">paleohacks</a>) about how blue light inhibits melatonin production, I got a really bright <a href="http://www.amazon.com/NatureBright-SunTouch-Plus-Light-Therapy/dp/B000W8Y7FY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327325517&amp;sr=8-1">LED "sun lamp"</a> and a pair of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Uvex-S1933X-Eyewear-SCT-Orange-Anti-Fog/dp/B000USRG90/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327325546&amp;sr=8-3">orange sunglasses</a> to try and trick my body into releasing that sweet, sweet melatonin I was missing. I started wearing the glasses around 6:30 every night, and using the lamp for about 45 minutes first thing in the morning while I program or read. Back in October, my wife, my sister, and I started running every other day, training for a 5k obstacle course. Unfortunately, once the mid-December cold arrived, we stopped entirely, because running in the freezing cold is miserable. Since I know exercise makes me feel great, I started <a href="http://nerdfitness.com/blog/2011/07/21/meet-staci-your-new-powerlifting-super-hero/">lifting heavy</a> every other day with squats, bench presses, and dead-lifts.

Between the bright sun lamp in the morning, the orange glasses for an hour or two before bed, our typical diet heavy on green veggies and legumes, and the heavy weight lifting, my mood, and, oddly, my mental faculties, have improved <strong>dramatically</strong> in just two weeks. I now sleep like a dead man, falling asleep in minutes, and waking up before my alarm almost every day. My mind feels shockingly clear and sharp. In the last few months, I have taken to programming or reading for an hour before work (which I will write more on later). The last two weeks, the tenacity and comprehension of my reading has ramped up considerably: I find myself much less often picking up a book to be entertained, and more often picking up books that stretch my cognitive abilities to the limits.

Take <em>that</em>, winter.
