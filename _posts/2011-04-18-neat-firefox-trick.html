<p>I am a lazy lazy man, and as such I do not like to waste time waiting for things or doing dumb stuff.<p />One place this is evident is in the browser. I like to know the cool shortcuts and tricks to speed me along my way, and Firefox has tons. Here are some neat tricks I learned this weekend.<p /> From anywhere in Firefox, <strong>Ctrl-k</strong> will take you to the "search bar" and <strong>Ctrl-L</strong> to the "address bar", that is cool, but it gets better.<p />When opening a new tab (<strong>Ctrl+t</strong>) it always defaults your cursor to the address bar. Now many people would just say, "hey steve, don't be a jerk, and just hit <strong>Tab</strong> to move to the search bar, then search." This works, but I search for stuff all the time, and like to cut down on keys even further. <p /> So, I wanted to make the address bar search google for me. To do this, go to about:config, and change the <strong>keyword.URL</strong> value to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sourceid=navclient&amp;gfns=0&amp;q=">http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sourceid=navclient&amp;gfns=0&amp;q=</a> <p /> By default, if you type in "facebook", Firefox will search google and redirect you to the "I'm Feeling Lucky" result, due to the gfns=1. The first result is <a href="http://facebook.com">facebook.com</a>, so that is where you go. But since much of what I type is real searching and not a url, I want to see the results! Changing your <strong>keyword.URL</strong> will still search google, but it will now take you to the results page, which saves me a few extra seconds each search. <p /> Now, in the rare case where I just want to go to Facebook.com, I pull another trick and just type "facebook" and then <strong>Ctrl-Enter</strong> which will pre-pend the "www." and append the ".com"<p /> Wheew, in five to seven years, this might just have saved me the time I spent learning it.<p />Practicality: 2/10<br />Cool nerd learning: 9/10</p><p>EDIT - While this is cool, and I do have it working on my machines, I ended up muscle memorizing the longer but far more portable method of just <strong>Ctrl-t Tab</strong> or <strong>Ctrl-t Ctrl-k</strong>. I know this is not nearly as cool, but hey, if I can open and save a file in emacs, <em>I can do <span style="font-family:mceinline;">anything</span>.</em></p>
