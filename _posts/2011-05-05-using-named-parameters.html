<p>Up until recently, most of my programming was in php, which does not support named parameters (<a href="http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/webprog/pcook/ch06_05.htm" target="_blank">this</a> doesn't count, and it will get you lynched) so while switching to VB.NET and python, I have come to really appreciate this handy feature.<p /> Named parameters is one of those handy little things that can make your life a little easier. Say, in python, you have a function that takes a boolean value. Normally, I would create a variable just to hold that boolean value, then pass it in, to try to be easier for the next guy to understand.</p><p><code>def do_stuff(): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; window(true)</code></p><p>Who knows what window's parameter is? What the heck is true anyway, the window? <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/" target="_blank">PyCharm</a> knows (and if you are using python without it, I implore you to treat yourself to the demo) otherwise you have to look up the function <em>like a barbarian</em> to see what is going on. Sure, you can make it more clear with:</p><p><code>def do_stuff():&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; collapse = true&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; window(collapse)</code></p><p>Better then nothing, but still lame.</p><p><code>def do_stuff(): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; window(collapse=true)</code></p><p>Boom! Way easier to read, no extra variables hanging around making trouble. Many times I have made function parameters, called them one thing, then made a variable with a slightly different name to pass in for legibility, but no more of that crap! Now, when I have the inclination to make a variable just to clarify something, I just name the parameter and pass in the value right there, like a civilized gentleman should.<p /> Additionally, VB.NET has this too, with the slightly goofier syntax of the ":="</p><p><code>Authenticate(pAllowBackupPassword:=True)</code></p><p>My cohort Daniel Miladinov pointed out that this is calling the assignment operator directly, since calling it with just the equals would perform an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equals_sign#In_computer_programming">equality operator</a>. Smart guy, Dan.</p>
