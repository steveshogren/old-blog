  My name is Steve, and I used to be a binge coder.

  When I first started programming full-time, I was hired with an
  embarassing lack of relavant skills. I felt guilty not advancing my
  skills in my free time, and that guilt, along with a bad case of
  imposter syndrome, stuck with me for a long time.

  built up like a pressure cooker. Usually, some Saturday morning I
  would binge code from like 6am till late in the evening. Looking
  back at my work after about 1pm, it was clearly worthless nonsense,
  but it would assuage my guilt for a few more days.

  Fast forward a few years, and GitHub comes out with their new
  "streak" feature on the front page. If you look there now at
  anything from about six months ago, you will see the telltale signs
  of a binge coder: nothing for two weeks, then fifty commits in one
  weekend. I looked at that chart, and thought, "what if I tried to
  instead just do a little everyday?". This idea came over from my
  workout routine, where I had given up on sproadic and inconsistent
  workouts to a system of "workout every day, no matter how dumb".

  I quickly realized that some projects are much better suited for
  working on everyday than others. Anything requiring well thought out
  plans and designs are hard to do, but anything structured out of a
  book is easy to start and stop. I started working through a book I
  had longed to read:
