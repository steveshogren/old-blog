  My name is Steve, and I used to be a binge coder.
</p>
<p>
  I like the feeling of being on top of my life. I like to feel like I
  am getting always improving myself spiritually, mentally,
  physically, and socially. In college I joined a society of men who
  make that their motto. Once I started programming full-time, I found
  I loved working on side-projects, and I would feel guilty not
  advancing in my field in my free time.
