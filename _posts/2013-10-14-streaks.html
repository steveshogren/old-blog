<p>
  My name is Steve, and I used to be a binge coder.
</p>
<p>
  When I first started programming full-time, I was hired with an
  embarassing lack of relavant skills. I felt really guilty not
  advancing my skills in my free time, and that guilt, along with a
  bad case of imposter syndrome, stuck with me for a long time.
</p>
<p>
  But, I am a lazy and easily distracted man. I would not do any extra
  work till my guilt built up like a pressure cooker. Usually, some
  Saturday morning I would binge code from like 6am till late in the
  evening. Looking back at my work after about 11am, it was clearly
  worthless nonsense, but it would assuage my guilt for a few more
  days.
</p>
<p>
  Fast forward a few years, and GitHub comes out with their new
  "streak" feature on the front page. If you look at my streak of
  anything from before six months ago, you will see the telltale signs
  of a binge coder: nothing for four weeks, then fifty commits in one
  weekend. I looked at that chart, and thought, "what if I tried to
  instead just do a little everyday?". This idea was a crossover from
  my workout routine, where I had moved from sproadic and inconsistent
  workouts to a system of "workout every day, no matter how small".
</p>
<p>
  I quickly realized that some projects are much better suited for
  working on everyday than others. Anything requiring well thought out
  plans and designs are hard to do, but anything structured out of a
  book is easy to start and stop. I started working through a book I
  longed to read but had never made any progess on: Let Over Lambda.
</p>
<p>
  Let Over Lambda is a tome, filled with deeply complex concepts
  written in Common Lisp, a language with which I was only passingly
  familiar. But I managed to get through it without hardly any
  difficulty. How did I do that?
</p>
<p>
  I got a netbook, and started to code on the train ride home.
  Interestingly, without any internet, I was much less distracted, and
  could just sit down and be in the zone within the minute (this from
  the guy whom it takes 20+ minutes to get in the zone at work). With only a
  limited span of ~25 minutes I had no time to waste, but also without
  people or distractions of any sort, my brain just falls into it. I
  can only pinpoint a few times I could not get into the zone, and
  those were extreme circumstances of utter exhaustion or illness.
</p>
<p>
  So far, I have worked through Let Over Lambda once and read it
  twice, worked twice through a book on making programming languages
  put out by Brown university (once in Scheme and once in F#), and I
  just finished chapter two of SICP (homework too, natch). I authored
  a Clojure library for runtime type checking, and poked around with
  macro abstractions for a Clojure game trying to put into place what
  I learned from LOL. I also prepared for an almost two hour talk
  about macros that I gave at the Clojadelphia meetup. All this in a
  little under six months of only ~25 minutes a day. I have improved
  mightly in such a short time, and it does not feel stressful in the
  least. Now, when I get home, if I feel like watching movies,
  cooking, or playing board games/Xbox all night, no problem! I can
  relax knowing I have exercised for ~45 minutes (I do that too every
  morning) and programmed just for me for almost 30 minutes. I try
  meditate on the train ride each way in the morning (probably only
  really happens 3 times a week, I am only human), which clocks me in
  at another ~25 minutes of spritual exercise a day. All in all, the
  last 6 months have been incredible, some of the most rewarding,
  relaxing, and fulfilling months of my life.
</p>
<p>
  Before you scoff and point out that not everyone can take the train
  to work, consider this: get a netbook, load up your environment,
  tools, and some pdfs. The next morning, leave for work ~25 minutes
  early. You will probably get in way sooner due to the decreased
  traffic (now you have earned back that time). Sit quietly in your
  car, and without the distractions of internet or other people, knock
  out a little programming. Maybe start with SICP (the best
  programming book I have ever read). See how much you can read and do
  before work starts. Do that for a month, every day; I guarentee you
  will learn something amazing.
