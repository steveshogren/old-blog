  My name is Steve, and I used to be a binge coder.
</p>
<p>
  I like the feeling of being on top of my life. I like to feel like I
  am getting always improving myself spiritually, mentally,
  physically, and socially. In college I joined a society of men who
  make that their motto. Once I started programming full-time, I found
  I loved working on side-projects, and I would feel guilty not
  advancing in my field in my free time.
</p>
<p>
  But, I am a lazy man, and I would not do any extra work till my
  guilt would build up like a pressure cooker. Then one Saturday
  morning, I would binge code from like 6am till late in the evening.
  Looking back at my work after about 1pm, I would see a marked
  decline in actual value, but it would assuage my guilt for a few
  days.

  Fast forward a few years, and GitHub comes out with their new
  "streak" feature on the front page.
