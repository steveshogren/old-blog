I have been playing around with lisp off and on for some time now. I started out in Emacs Lisp, making Emacs play as nice (nicer in some ways) as any available php ide, but then dropped off after discovering <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PhpStorm</a> from JetBrains. When I heard about <a href="http://landoflisp.com/">Land of Lisp</a>, I was intrigued and picked up a copy to work through over Christmas, got a few chapters in, but as Christmas tends to go for me, I spent much of the time playing board games with the family.<p /> And through it all, I never had even the slightest inkling of why <a href="http://thecleancoder.blogspot.com/2010/08/why-clojure.html">everyone</a> says you <a href="http://xahlee.org/UnixResource_dir/writ/wl_lisp.html">should </a>learn <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">lisp</a>. <a href="http://bc.tech.coop/blog/040314.html">These guys too</a>. <p /> What is the deal? Surely, I am using it wrong. Everyone who learns it raves, and yet after using it off and on for several years, all I see is just another language, with a steeper learning curve from the non-C, non-VB syntax.<p /> Then, last week, <a href="http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/lisp.html">this</a> article came across my browser.<p />I read just the first quarter, and there was a riot in my brain.
